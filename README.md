# fluxbot
A Hubot-based chatbot for driving [FluxCD](https://fluxcd.io)'s `fluxctl`

## Project Status
This is a WORK IN PROGRESS. There's currently no tests or CI. The code is dumb at the moment. It's annoyingly opinionated right now on where you put your flux install, your container registry, and your deployable workloads. It will get better over time, but you may never love it.

## Why does this exist
To allow Kubernetes admins to provide a "chat ops with guardrails" functionality to developers who need control over which image a workload is running at a given time but who can't/shouldn't access other things in the cluster.

## What can this do

* `fluxbot workloads` shows all workloads in the `applications` namespace (on-demand namespace coming soon)
* `fluxbot images` issues `fluxctl list-images -n applications`
* `fluxbot deploy [WORKLOAD NAME WITHOUT NAMESPACE] [IMAGE PATH] [IMAGE TAG]` issues an opinionated `fluxctl release`

## Development

### Prerequisite
* You need NPM. On macOS this is easiest as `brew install npm`
* `npm install generator-hubot yo`
* `yo hubot`


### Hubot Dev
* This builds from the image that the stable Hubot Helm chart uses, adding `fluxctl` and our custom scripts.
* `fluxctl` is currently vendor'd in here. That will change later.
* Yeoman install artifacts are ignored by Git, but they're part of the dev workflow. To hack on the scripts:
	* `yo hubot` sets this up as a fully fledged Hubot project (this is done in the Dockerfile otherwise)	
	* `bin/hubot` will put you into the "console" adapter for Hubot and allow you to run commands against the `fluxctl` bin in your $PATH against your current K8s context.
